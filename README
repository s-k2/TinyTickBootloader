Bootloader for TinyTick
-----------------------

This is the bootloader for TinyTick, a simple board based on the ATtiny 44!

If you just want to flash the bootloader to a brand-new microprocessor, you
don't need to build this, just take the file TinyBootloader.hex in the bin-
directory.

If you want to change the source-code you need an avr-gcc-toolchain. The
development has been done on version 2.8.1, but it should be no problem
to use any other version of avr-gcc.

To build it, just call "make" within this directory!
